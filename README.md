# Malaysia Travel Gate – Frontend (Dummy Data)

## 📌 Overview

This is the **frontend only** for Malaysia Travel Gate.
There is **no backend** connected in this version — all the data you see comes from **dummy arrays** in the JavaScript.

## 🎨 Developer Guidelines

* Be **as creative as possible** with the design.
* Use **modern UI elements** (cards, hover effects, animations, transitions).
* The goal is to make the page **look like a premium travel booking site**.
* Feel free to adjust:

  * **Colors**
  * **Layout**
  * **Typography**
  * **Icons and images**
  * **Interactive elements (hover, expand, slider)**

⚡ The more **details, polish, and unique design touches** you add → the more **bonus points** you will earn.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

* **Countries & Regions** dropdowns (dummy data: Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia).
* **Tours List** – shows dummy tours with logo, name, duration, price, and includes/excludes.
* **Must Visit Places** – dummy famous places with images and descriptions.
* **Sorting** – sort by price, duration, or date (works with dummy data).

   * OR run with **Live Server** in VS Code.
   * OR run with Python:

     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

     Then open 👉 [http://localhost:8000/search\_result\_page.html](http://localhost:8000/search_result_page.html)
3. Everything runs on **dummy data**, no backend required.

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Later, this frontend will connect to a **Node.js / Express backend + database**.
* For now, focus is **only on frontend look & feel**.

✨ **Reminder**: The project will reward **creative, innovative designs**.
Don’t just stick to plain HTML/CSS — add animations, transitions, clean layouts, and make it stand out.
